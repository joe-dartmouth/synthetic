# Development: the environment, the gate and its hazards

How this repository is built, checked and run. [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) keeps the working
summary; this file is the full record behind it. The repository's own checkers are described in
[`tools/README.md`](../tools/README.md).

## Environment

Requires `uv`. The interpreter version is the one in `.python-version`, and `uv` downloads it when
the machine lacks it. `make setup` installs the `dev` extra from the lock, and
`source .venv/bin/activate` enters the environment.

- **Runtime dependencies are optional extras, declared and locked but installed on demand**: `data`
  (numpy, pandas), `ontology` (owlready2, pronto), `llm` (anthropic), `synth` (sdv,
  imbalanced-learn), `eval` (scikit-learn, sdmetrics) and `app` (streamlit). ADR
  [`tooling/uv-ruff-ty`](adr/tooling/uv-ruff-ty.md) states when an extra joins `make setup`.
  `make sync` installs every extra.
- **Install an extra the lock-faithful way**: copy the `setup` recipe out of the `Makefile` and
  append `--extra <name>`. `uv sync` is exact, so a bare `uv sync --extra <name>` removes the
  others. Never `uv pip install -e ".[...]"`: it resolves fresh rather than from the lock, and
  `make synced` refuses the result.
- **Change a dependency with `uv lock`, then `make setup`.** Both install targets run
  `uv sync --locked`, which refuses a lock that disagrees with `pyproject.toml` instead of
  rewriting it, and every gate step runs `uv run --no-sync`, so nothing but an explicit `uv lock`
  writes `uv.lock`. `tests/test_repo_gate.py` compares the two offline as well.
- **Build backends are pinned** in `[tool.uv] build-constraint-dependencies`, because uv resolves
  them outside the lock: hatchling for `bko`, and setuptools, wheel and Cython for owlready2, which
  ships only an sdist.

## Platforms

The gate is POSIX-only: macOS and Linux. The checkers shell out to `git`, and the Makefile recipes
assume a POSIX shell.

**Use an SSH remote.** The checkers run `git` with global config blanked, which also drops any
global credential helper. With an HTTPS remote, `make rebased` cannot authenticate its `ls-remote`
probe, so it passes only in its degraded form and never confirms the trunk is current.

## Make targets

| Target | What it runs | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `setup` | `uv sync --locked` with the `dev` extra and the pinned interpreter | Refuses a stale lock |
| `sync` | `uv sync --locked --all-extras` | The whole lock, every extra |
| `lint` | `ruff check .` then `ruff format --check .` | `ruff format` reaches Python fenced in markdown |
| `format` | `ruff format .` | Rewrites files, documentation fences included; not part of the gate |
| `typecheck` | `ty check` | `ty.toml` sets the platform and paths; `pyrightconfig.json` is for editors |
| `test` | `pytest -n auto --dist worksteal --cov` | Sources, branch coverage and `fail_under` live in `pyproject.toml` |
| `sizes` | `python -m tools.check_file_size` | ADR [`tooling/file-size-cap`](adr/tooling/file-size-cap.md) |
| `synced` | `python -m tools.check_lock_drift` | Installed packages against `uv.lock` |
| `rebased` | `python -m tools.check_rebased` | Probes `origin` with `git ls-remote`; ADR [`tooling/refuse-a-stale-trunk-ref`](adr/tooling/refuse-a-stale-trunk-ref.md) |
| `rebased-final` | The same checker again | Runs last, because the trunk can move while the tests run |
| `check` | `rebased synced lint sizes typecheck test rebased-final` | `.NOTPARALLEL`, so the order is a guarantee |

Every step from `lint` down runs as `uv run --no-sync`: the gate measures the environment
`make setup` built and never re-locks or installs during a run.

The `check` order puts what invalidates other steps first: a rebase can move `uv.lock`, which
invalidates `synced`, and a drifted environment makes `lint` and `typecheck` report errors that
belong to the environment rather than the tree. `sizes` precedes `test` because it is the cheaper
of the two.

## No CI, no hooks

There is no CI workflow and no git hook. `make check` is the whole gate and a person runs it before
opening a pull request. Name in the PR whether the whole gate or a targeted subset stands behind
it.

A targeted run while working:

- `make rebased synced lint sizes`, always: each guards something a narrow test run cannot see.
- `make typecheck` for any `.py` change.
- The test modules for what changed, without coverage, for example
  `uv run --no-sync pytest tests/test_file_size.py -q -p no:cacheprovider --no-cov </dev/null`. A
  run whose every selected test skips exits 1, so a selection that reaches nothing cannot pass;
  `--allow-all-skipped` opts out where that is the intent.
- Every test module that names the changed file, found with `grep -rlF '<basename>' tests/`.

## Gate hazards

- **Stage before the gate.** `make sizes`, the conflict-marker scan and the root-file check read
  `git ls-files`, so an untracked file is under no gate.
- **Do not edit the tree while the gate runs.** Coverage resolves line numbers at report time, so an
  edit fakes a coverage miss below the edit point.
- **Do not run two covered gates at once.** They consume each other's `.coverage.*` fragments.
  Check `pgrep -f "pytest -n auto"` first and delete leftover `.coverage.*` files.
- **Paid tests are opt-in.** A test marked `live` calls a paid API and is skipped unless `--live`
  is passed; no `-m` expression selects it.
- **One test reaches the network.** The `check_rebased` recipe case in `tests/test_git_runner.py`
  runs the real probe against `origin` and carries the `integration` marker;
  `-m "not integration"` deselects it.
